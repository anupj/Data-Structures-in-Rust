# Data structures in Rust

Rust implementation of challenges and problems covered in
[structy.net](https://structy.net) data structures and
algorithm course.

The course has Javascript, Python, and C++ implementation.
I've re-implemented the logic in Rust in this code repo.

**This course is highly recommended if you want to learn or
refresh your knowledge about data structures and algorithms.**
